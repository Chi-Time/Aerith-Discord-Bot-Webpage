<p>Aerith Bot is a user-created Discord bot for the Discord application. She is created within the C# language using the unofficial Discord.NET API.</p>

<p>She is designed to help interact with others, provide entertainment, decisions and games. You can explore her various functionality at the following wiki: <a href="https://bitbucket.org/Gardevoir/aerith-discord-bot/wiki/Home">documentation</a></p>

<p>Aerith bot is created by a single person. She was originally developed and designed for work on a small server with my friends. But, since development has gone so well, I hope that she can be used for many others. Whilst I have no professional experience in the realms of software development, I hope the bot can be of use.</p>

<p>As stated above. Aerith was created solely by me, James Johnson (<a href="https://github.com/guardevoir" class="user-mention">@guardevoir</a>) a small time software dev hobbyist and full time student of games programming. That being said, much of her source code was created in part with the help and understanding of many other bots and projects. Some of immediate use are: <a href="https://github.com/Kwoth/NadekoBot">Nadeko</a>, <a href="https://github.com/davidlimjh/TatsuBot">Tatsu</a></p>

<p>As well as these, it cannot be stated, that without the unofficial <a href="https://github.com/RogueException/Discord.Net">Discord.NET</a> API. None of her creation would have been possible. This API is all thanks to the starting work done by: <a href="https://github.com/RogueException" class="user-mention">@RogueException</a></p>
